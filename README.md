This repository contains the IBM LMIC (LoraMAC-in-C) library, slightly modified to
match the frequency plan of TheThingsNetwork.

Supported hardware in this repository are the stm32 based IMST/WiMOD boards. Alternatives
are for instance the NUCLEO L152RE boards equipped with a SX1276MB1xAS LoRa radio board.
https://developer.mbed.org/components/SX1276MB1xAS.

For building and flashing, GNU ARM cross compiler toolchain and OpenOCD are sufficient.

For more information, follow the documentation in the 'doc' folder.
